# petAgeConverter
A program that gives a rough estimate on the age of your pet(currently limited to cat and dogs) based on research of animal aging process compared to a human. Aging was based on the following websites. https://pets.webmd.com/dogs/how-to-calculate-your-dogs-age and https://www.catster.com/cats-101/calculate-cat-age-in-cat-years 

Comparing age of an animal with ours
Without any anthropomorphism, it is legitimate to question the age of the animal, and especially its advanced old age, to prevent age-related diseases, for example.

Most of our pets become adults quickly: they live a very short youth.
In the other hand, often, things are spread over longer maturity and old ageâ€¦
